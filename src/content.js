At the time, they were planning to push new kinds of services because they think that the reason behind low purchase is that users are not interested in the service they are providing. However, I was skeptical about this assumption because there isn’t enough user and user experience data to support it. I felt detached from users and didn’t understand why people would pay to chat when there are tons of free social media apps out there. <u>Nevertheless, I sensed that my team was enthusiastic about launching new services and it would be hard to change their minds.</u>",

  // goal: "I pointed out to my team that the data we currently have is not enough to conclude that new services can solve the problem of low purchase rate. I suggested we should do some research to learn about users’ opinions and experience of our app. After getting approval from my team leader, I then refined my research goals. Recognizing that our mobile app has two important components that will affect users’ choice of purchasing – the services (and staff) on the app, and the app itself. Therefore, I set the research goal to investigate both parts – <u>for the app and the services respectively, finding out current users’ expectations, opinions, and their pain points while using the app or experiencing our services.</u> I then phrased the research questions that will guide my survey design: ",
  rationale: "<li>To get a large amount users' opinions and attitude about our app and current services — see whether team's assumption is correct</li><li>To get a sense of potential pain points</li><li>To filter respondents for potential follow-up interviews</li>",
  interview: "So I reached out to the respondents of the survey who expressed interest in a follow-up interview. My questions were designed to probe their opinions about pricing, their experience with the app and staff, and what prevent them from placing an order.",
  interviewgoal: "<b>Refine research goal</b><li>Understand why users do not place an order</li><li>Understand users’ opinion about the pricing</li><li>Understand users’ experience with the app and staff</li>",
  interviewaudience:"<b>Recruit participants</b><li>Subset of survey respondents</li><li>Free users</li><li>High-paying users</li>",
  interviewquestions: "<li>For users who made consumption: Why is the experience with staff not satisfied?</li><li>For users with no consumption: What prevents them from making a purchase? What were their opinions about the staff?</li>",
  interviewresult: "With around 40 interviews, I discovered three factors: <li>Users are confused about how the service works out</li><li>Users haven’t found a staff they are interested in (our staff are mostly college students)</li><li>Users think that the app has a strong purpose to make profit which makes them feel uncomfortable.</li>",
  interviewlimitation: "While reporting my insights from interviews, I also informed potential biases about my research: <li>Participants are primarily female young adults. (Though later they become the app's main target audience)</li><li>Data all based on participants' recall and thus can be biased</li>",
  recommend1:"<b>Insufficient information</b><br/>Add new users guide, clear contents on how to use it",
  recommend2:"<b>Staff/Service quality</b><br/><li>Recruit staff with more experience</li><li>Divide staff into 2 parts – entertaining and professional</li>",
  recommend3:"<b>Strong purpose to make profit</b><br/>Add free features to give users a transition, let them realize the value of the app",
  impact: "<li>Better documentation: clarify each service we provide and the value we offer to users</li><li>Increased purchase rate.</li><li>Deeper understanding about who our users are and what potential services users are interested in</li><li>My team learned that user-centered thinking doesn't just mean knowing their demographics and app behaviors.

  methodology: "<b>SELECTING METHOD -- SURVEYS as a start</b><br/>I decided to start by conducting surveys because it is an easy and quick way to learn about users’ perceptions and attitudes about the app and services with a large data set. In addition, it helps to get my team on board since they have an inclination to accept quantitative data results. <br/><br/><b>DESIGN & REFINE SURVEYS</b><br/>I then designed three versions of the survey based on users’ different consumption times, 0, 1~2, and 3+. The survey contained closed questions, rating questions, and open questions. After doing some pilot testing on teammates and making some revisions, I then posted it in our app since we were gathering current users’ experience with our app.<br/><br/><b>ANALYZE SURVEYS & REPORT FINDINGS</b><br/>I ended up collecting 225 survey responses. I filtered these respondents’ information in our database to synthesize their consumption behavior with their responses, and analyzed the three types of consumptions separately. I was able to answer some of the research questions I raised, especially regarding my team’s assumption that users are not interested in our current services. I reported my findings but pointed out that there were still questions unanswered such as how to make improvements. And I saw lots of potentiality to probe further in participants’ response to the open questions. My team lead, who was delighted with the insights generated from the research, agreed and offered that we should give more virtual money to users who would like to be interviewed.<br/><br/><b>SELCTING METHOD -- SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW for the why & how</b><br/>This time, my research goal was focused on understanding their experiences with staff for the consumers who made a purchase, and for users with no consumption, I would ask follow-up questions on reasons that prevent them from making consumptions. I will only focus on these two types of users. I then proceeded to plan in-depth user interviews. I decided to reach out to users who have taken the survey and who made less than 2 purchases. There would not be many predetermined research questions this time. I would review his or her survey before each interview and probe into specific responses that I found interesting. After conducting thematic analysis by color coding different terms to find common themes among different users, I then synthesized findings from surveys and reported my insights and suggestions to my team.",
  takeaways: "Now looking back, I should've conducted some remote usability tests during follow-up interviews to explore what users are struggling with instead of only relying on their recall. In addition, I learned that as a researcher, it is not only important to do the research, but also convince others to believe that your research is useful, even if you don't rely on a large amount of representative data.",
  analysis: "I collected 225 surveys and conducted 40+ user interviews through wechat. The quantitative data from the survey was analyzed by the survey platform. I further conducted thematic analysis on qualitative data by <u>color coding different terms to find common themes among different users</u>.",

We recruited students that meet the minimum requirement without further specification and they all had different needs that we were not aware of. <br/><br/>If I could do it again, I would start with participants who are more likely interested in our design concept.

So it came to us that we should categorize our users and identify needs for each specific group in order to create more specific and useful features.<br/><br/>Secondly, we realize that we should <u>reach out to various subject matter experts earlier</u> in our project, such as the Washington Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence, to learn about how they are raising awareness of foodborne illness. In the beginning, we were just focusing on recruiting people inside the community. It occurred to us during the usability testing that if we talked to experts earlier, we might have gotten more insights on our design ideas.<br/><br/>Last but not least, we should <u>conduct pilot testing before usability testing.</u> The biggest problem in this project is that we cannot tell if it is our prototype not working or the idea of making the invisible visible not strong enough.",

So I moved to Reddit and found 12 posts around the topic: \"How to speak up more in meeting?\" Around those posts there are 20 people in total sharinng their reasons for not speaking up. From their self-identified reasoning, I concluded that personal factors are the top reasons that prevent people from speaking up.

  // step2: "In order to further explore the problem space, I then moved onto in-person interviews. I did 7 interviews, 1 - 1.5 hrs each, 4 of the interviewees used to have difficulties from speaking up, 2 of them don't have difficulties but choose not to speak up in certain meetings and all of them can speak up with ease in at least one meeting.

  // step3: "From user interview, I got to know how people change from not speaking up to speaking up with ease. I learned how susceptible people are to the external environment. I started to jump out the personal factors and decided to deal with the problem from these external factors. Yes, the personal problems still exist, but I want to set up the right environment so that when people enter this environment, they feel comfortable enough to speak up. After further digging into the barriers that prevent people from speaking up, I decided to focus on opaqueness existing among people in the workplace, the inefficiency of information sharing among people <b>-- One big reason for people not speaking up is that they don't know others', espcially leaders' expectations and sometimes not enough professional knowledge to provide valuable input.</b>",
  step3: " — that prevents people from speaking up. It is usually difficult, if not impossible, for us to know what others expect from us. Without such knowledge, we tend to push hard on ourselves and believe others' have high expectations on us, when in reality this may not be the case.  Yes, the personal problems still exist, but I want to set up the right environment so that when people enter this environment, they feel comfortable enough to speak up. I want to break the opaqueness existing among people and let everyone be genuine to one other. <br/><br/> What got me here was my finding from my user interviews that people proceed from not speaking up to speaking up as time goes by. I was initially frustrated because I thought that I am the only one who continues to struggle in meetings. However, I then realized that an important difference between us was that they had worked for their companies for years, while I kept changing environment and having meetings with new people. I gradually pinpointed on familiarity, which led to my aha moment about the importance of understanding each other's expectations and have sufficient professional knowledge to provide valuable inputs.",

We presented iter1 to a person who is not familiar with this challenge. She said that she didn't know exactly what these roles are and she had no idea which one she could fit in.

It is very common that we update our design based on one feedback and another person wants it to change back. In such situation, we really need to justify our design choice to move forward instead of back and forth. We thus tried to use github issue feature to keep track of all the updates we've had and the potential concerns we had. However, not everyone in our team was comfortable with using github. After submitting several issues, none of us keep updating those.",
  step3_3: "And finally we decided to go back to the simplest method: google docs. It is easily accessible to everyone and we always used it to take notes and feedback. All we needed to do was just organize those notes to one file. Now everyone is getting better and better taking notes on the feedback or updates we have.

  challenge: "We started our project by interviewing Yuan Jing, our client and the owner of Lito Nail. From the interview, we discovered a current problem and also the main reason why Yuan wants a website: the exclusive customer group. The current customer group is mainly consisted of international students and thus when it is not school time, there will be few customers to the salon since most of the students are out of town. Therefore, Yuan hopes to use the website to attract more residents around San Diego area in order for a more stable customer group. So how can we attract more local residents to the salon?",
  step1: "In order to better understand the advantages of Lito Nail, we decided to first interview its regular customers to understand why they choose Lito Nail over other salons. We stayed at Lito Nail for 3 days and interviewed 10 people in total. 7/10 were international students currently living in San Diego (main customer group), 1/10 was an international student on her vacation and 1/10 was a manicurist in Lito Nail. From those international students, we find out what makes Lito Nail stand out: <br/><b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 Customized style</b>: they will suggest and design styles for different customers. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226<b> High-quality nail polishes and many choices of decors</b>: they use imported nail polishes which don’t have bad smell; moreover, they provide many choices of decorations that go onto nails. <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Cozy environment & friendly manicurists</b>: most regular customers become friends with Yuan after coming to Lito Nail.</b> <br/><br/> In addition, from the manicurist with experience in another salon whose main customer group was local residents, we also realized why Lito Nail lacks local residents: <br/> <b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 High price</b>: because of the exquisite style and high quality of nail polish, Lito Nail is more expensive than other nail salon. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Limited ways of marketing</b>: all of the users being interviewed hear about this salon through Wechat (a popular Chinese social media); the rate on Yelp is not high and according to Yuan, many good reviews were deleted for no reasons. We also realized after interviewing the manicurist that it’s important to hear from local residents who favor other salons. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we didn’t get to interview any local residents other than the manicurist. We learnt that before conducting user interviews, it’s important to have a general idea about different user types rather than just randomly interviewing any customers that walk into the salon.",
  step2: "Gathering from client and user interviews, we reconsidered our problem to be more specific – how can we show off Lito Nail’s unique branding? How do we emphasize Lito Nail’s advantages over its drawbacks? We decided to show off Lito Nail from 2 main aspects – <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Its luxurious, personalized and diverse Japanese style. <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 High quality nail polish and exquisite meaning. <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 We will also emphasize its discounts to appeal to customers who care about the pricing.</b><br/><br/> We then searched for competitors’ website in order to have a better understanding about necessary features. After creating a compeitive analysis as well as a moodboard we then scheduled a meeting with Yuan to get feedback from her.",

  img6_1: litonail_paper,

We noticed that new customers were mostly introduced by their friends – those who they trust. So who would a random person who wants manicure trust? Probably fashion influencers!

  //Important to learn from co-workers even if you are not in the same department.
  //It is important to think from different aspects and think reversely to find the best solution.
  //Sometimes I do not have the ability to solve the whole problem, but I can still start from small places and instigate further changes.
  //Lastly, I really appreciated my experience at Bainbridge. And it is a
  // I had a deeper understanding about design. It was like sorting out a messy line. We were given a big task such as designing a website. In order to do it, we need to first start somewhere, and keep making small progress. Sometimes we need to look at the big pictures and sometimes we just need to work on our current task and the next step will present itself naturally. Just make progress step by step and months later you will see the result of your efforts.
  takeaway2: "I also became more confident as a designer. I used to think that my job was just listening to stakeholders’ opinions. However, it turned out that my thinking is crucial to push the project forward because while stakeholders have a general direction and think from business aspects, I am the one who is dealing with all the details and thinking from aspects such as development and user experience, which are important to reach a better result.",

  subtitle: "determined to become a UX researcher & designer",
  intro: "Nice to meet you! Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in Information Management with a focus on User Experience at UW Seattle.<br/><br/>I studied cognitive science at UCSD for my B.S. degree. With my habits of reading books, mostly science topics such as neuroscience, I develop the habit of interpreting people and the world critically from different angles. In my free time, I enjoy exercising, reading, and wandering in grocery stores. I am always working hard to become a better me.",

  journey: "I'm always guided by the fundamental question -- \"What is most important to me?\" Currently, what I value most is to accept who I am, and try my best to achieve the career and life I want -- become a UX researcher and make meaningful contributions to people's lives. <br/><br/>I love reading, especially science topics that help me to reflect myself and the world objectively from a distance. I also enjoy enjoy exercising, sketching, ballet, and wandering in grocery stores",
  passion1: "My journey into UX started with a life-changing podcast. It was a story about UX designers inventing one-handed keyboards so that nurses could operate systems with just one hand and use another to comfort patients. I was deeply intrigued by the empathy they show towards the patients. What enthralled me most was how they identified the needs of patients in the first place.<br/><br/>As I learn more and read more, I am increasingly aware that nothing should be taken for granted. I love the quote from one of my design classes, written by German poet Novalis – ",
  quote: " <i>\"To romanticize the world is to make us aware of the magic, mystery and wonder of the world; it is to educate the senses to see the ordinary as extraordinary, the familiar as strange, the mundane as sacred, the finite as infinite.\" -- Novalis</i>",
  intro1: "I love this quote from my design class. This is the attitude towards life I endorse and consciously develop. I believe that our world and our lives could be different, in a slow but better way. I want to be part of those incremental changes.",
  intro2: "I love reading. I love learning what I previously don't know, challenging my existing ideas, and inspiring new ones. I especially enjoy topics such as neuroscience and psychology which shed light on human behaviors.",
  intro3: "I'm also constantly improving myself, either physically, mentally, or intellectually. And I like to construct a theory based on scientific findings to ensure the change is positive and long-term, kind of like doing research. For instance, about two years ago I realized that I unconsciously swipe my phone whenever I'm boring or anxious. At the time I was reading a book ",

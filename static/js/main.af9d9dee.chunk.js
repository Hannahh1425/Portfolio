Yes, the personal problems still exist, but I want to set up the right environment so that when people enter this environment, they feel comfortable enough to speak up. I want to break the opaqueness existing among people and let everyone be genuine to one other. <br/><br/> What got me here was my finding from my user interviews that people proceed from not speaking up to speaking up as time goes by. I was initially frustrated because I thought that I am the only one who continues to struggle in meetings. However, I then realized that an important difference between us was that they had worked for their companies for years, while I kept changing environment and having meetings with new people.

From the interview, we discovered a current problem and also the main reason why Yuan wants a website: the exclusive customer group. The current customer group is mainly consisted of international students and thus when it is not school time, there will be few customers to the salon since most of the students are out of town. Therefore, Yuan hopes to use the website to attract more residents around San Diego area in order for a more stable customer group. So how can we attract more local residents to the salon?",step1:"In order to better understand the advantages of Lito Nail, we decided to first interview its regular customers to understand why they choose Lito Nail over other salons. We stayed at Lito Nail for 3 days and interviewed 10 people in total. 7/10 were international students currently living in San Diego (main customer group), 1/10 was an international student on her vacation and 1/10 was a manicurist in Lito Nail. From those international students, we find out what makes Lito Nail stand out: <br/><b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 Customized style</b>: they will suggest and design styles for different customers. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226<b> High-quality nail polishes and many choices of decors</b>: they use imported nail polishes which don\u2019t have bad smell; moreover, they provide many choices of decorations that go onto nails. <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Cozy environment & friendly manicurists</b>: most regular customers become friends with Yuan after coming to Lito Nail.</b> <br/><br/> In addition, from the manicurist with experience in another salon whose main customer group was local residents, we also realized why Lito Nail lacks local residents: <br/> <b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 High price</b>: because of the exquisite style and high quality of nail polish, Lito Nail is more expensive than other nail salon. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Limited ways of marketing</b>: all of the users being interviewed hear about this salon through Wechat (a popular Chinese social media); the rate on Yelp is not high and according to Yuan, many good reviews were deleted for no reasons. We also realized after interviewing the manicurist that it\u2019s important to hear from local residents who favor other salons. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we didn\u2019t get to interview any local residents other than the manicurist. We learnt that before conducting user interviews, it\u2019s important to have a general idea about different user types rather than just randomly interviewing any customers that walk into the salon.",step2:"Gathering from client and user interviews, we reconsidered our problem to be more specific \u2013 how can we show off Lito Nail\u2019s unique branding?

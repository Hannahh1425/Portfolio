Co. Ltd.. The app’s main feature was to offer paid companionship services to users such as virtual girlfriend/boyfriend, wake-up call etc. When I joined this company as an operation intern, the app was just released in the app stores for several months and its operation team was taking a growth hacking strategy – rapid application iteration and regular A/B testing with the goal of improving customer journey quickly with relatively low investment. My responsibility was to conduct daily data analysis such as revenue, daily new users, conduct analysis on app features to measure iteration effectiveness, and produce reports to suggest iteration directions.\",\r\n  problem: \"Despite rapid iterations of the app, we found that <u>user purchase and repurchase rate kept being low.</u> Yet my team was still repeating the same iteration process which was relying on usage data analytics and internal discussion. At the time, they were planning to push new kinds of services because they think that the reason behind low purchase is that users are not interested in the service they are providing. However, I was skeptical about this assumption because there isn’t enough user and user experience data to support it. I felt detached from users and didn’t understand why people would pay to chat when there are tons of free social media apps out there. <u>Nevertheless, I sensed that my team was enthusiastic about launching new services and it would be hard to change their minds.</u>\",\r\n  problemimg: sweet_problem,\r\n  goal: \"I pointed out to my team that the data we currently have is not enough to conclude that new services can solve the problem of low purchase rate. I suggested we should do some research to learn about users’ opinions and experience of our app. After getting approval from my team leader, I then refined my research goals. Recognizing that our mobile app has two important components that will affect users’ choice of purchasing – the services (and staff) on the app, and the app itself. Therefore, I set the research goal to investigate both parts – <u>for the app and the services respectively, finding out current users’ expectations, opinions, and their pain points while using the app or experiencing our services.</u> I then phrased the research questions that will guide my survey design: \",\r\n  methodimg: sweet_method,\r\n  methodology: \"<b>SELECTING METHOD -- SURVEYS as a start</b><br/>I decided to start by conducting surveys because it is an easy and quick way to learn about users’ perceptions and attitudes about the app and services with a large data set. In addition, it helps to get my team on board since they have an inclination to accept quantitative data results. <br/><br/><b>DESIGN & REFINE SURVEYS</b><br/>I then designed three versions of the survey based on users’ different consumption times, 0, 1~2, and 3+. The survey contained closed questions, rating questions, and open questions. After doing some pilot testing on teammates and making some revisions, I then posted it in our app since we were gathering current users’ experience with our app.<br/><br/><b>ANALYZE SURVEYS & REPORT FINDINGS</b><br/>I ended up collecting 225 survey responses. I filtered these respondents’ information in our database to synthesize their consumption behavior with their responses, and analyzed the three types of consumptions separately. I was able to answer some of the research questions I raised, especially regarding my team’s assumption that users are not interested in our current services. I reported my findings but pointed out that there were still questions unanswered such as how to make improvements. And I saw lots of potentiality to probe further in participants’ response to the open questions. My team lead, who was delighted with the insights generated from the research, agreed and offered that we should give more virtual money to users who would like to be interviewed.<br/><br/><b>SELCTING METHOD -- SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW for the why & how</b><br/>This time, my research goal was focused on understanding their experiences with staff for the consumers who made a purchase, and for users with no consumption, I would ask follow-up questions on reasons that prevent them from making consumptions. I will only focus on these two types of users. I then proceeded to plan in-depth user interviews. I decided to reach out to users who have taken the survey and who made less than 2 purchases. There would not be many predetermined research questions this time. I would review his or her survey before each interview and probe into specific responses that I found interesting. After conducting thematic analysis by color coding different terms to find common themes among different users, I then synthesized findings from surveys and reported my insights and suggestions to my team.\",\r\n  question: \"For the app itself:<li>What are users’ attitude towards our app?</li><li>What were users’ expectations when downloading this app? Was our app what they expected?</li><li>Are users satisfied with their experience so far? Will they recommend it to their friends?</li><br/>For the services:<li>What is their opinion about the paid companionship services?</li><li>For users who made a consumption: Why did they make a purchase? How was their experience with the staff? </li><li>For users with no consumption: What prevents them from making a purchase? What were their opinions about the staff?</li>\",\r\n  survey: \"First I worked with Yihan to brainstorm potential hypothesis for the low frequency of user consumption, and generated a list of questions we want to cover. I then designed 3 versions of surveys based on users' consumption frequency -- those who never make a purchase, those who made less than 2 purchases within a month, and those who made more than 2.\",\r\n  analysis: \"I collected 225 surveys and conducted 40+ user interviews through wechat. The quantitative data from the survey was analyzed by the survey platform. I further conducted thematic analysis on qualitative data by <u>color coding different terms to find common themes among different users</u>.\",\r\n  resultimg: sweet_result,\r\n  finding: \"With the surveys and user interviews, I was able to answer my research questions.

From the interview, we discovered a current problem and also the main reason why Yuan wants a website: the exclusive customer group. The current customer group is mainly consisted of international students and thus when it is not school time, there will be few customers to the salon since most of the students are out of town. Therefore, Yuan hopes to use the website to attract more residents around San Diego area in order for a more stable customer group. So how can we attract more local residents to the salon?\",\r\n  step1: \"In order to better understand the advantages of Lito Nail, we decided to first interview its regular customers to understand why they choose Lito Nail over other salons. We stayed at Lito Nail for 3 days and interviewed 10 people in total. 7/10 were international students currently living in San Diego (main customer group), 1/10 was an international student on her vacation and 1/10 was a manicurist in Lito Nail. From those international students, we find out what makes Lito Nail stand out: <br/><b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 Customized style</b>: they will suggest and design styles for different customers. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226<b> High-quality nail polishes and many choices of decors</b>: they use imported nail polishes which don’t have bad smell; moreover, they provide many choices of decorations that go onto nails. <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Cozy environment & friendly manicurists</b>: most regular customers become friends with Yuan after coming to Lito Nail.</b> <br/><br/> In addition, from the manicurist with experience in another salon whose main customer group was local residents, we also realized why Lito Nail lacks local residents: <br/> <b> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 High price</b>: because of the exquisite style and high quality of nail polish, Lito Nail is more expensive than other nail salon. <br/>  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &#8226 <b>Limited ways of marketing</b>: all of the users being interviewed hear about this salon through Wechat (a popular Chinese social media); the rate on Yelp is not high and according to Yuan, many good reviews were deleted for no reasons. We also realized after interviewing the manicurist that it’s important to hear from local residents who favor other salons. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we didn’t get to interview any local residents other than the manicurist. We learnt that before conducting user interviews, it’s important to have a general idea about different user types rather than just randomly interviewing any customers that walk into the salon.\",\r\n  step2: \"Gathering from client and user interviews, we reconsidered our problem to be more specific – how can we show off Lito Nail’s unique branding? How do we emphasize Lito Nail’s advantages over its drawbacks?
